# pic32mx

This is a series of basic projects (including Eagle schematics) for the [PIC32MX270F256B](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC32mx270f256b) microcontroller, a 28-pin DIP CPU featuring 256KB of program space and 64KB of RAM. (This makes it an excellent CPU to use in place of the Atmel ATMega processors if you want to write bigger programs and use more memory.)

All these projects are built using the [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide) for the Macintosh, and the [MPLab PICKit 4 In-Circuit Debugger](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/PG164140).

## VerifyLED

The first project is a very simple one which flashes an LED. This allows you to test to make sure that you can wire up a PIC32 processor correctly and wire an LED to it, and verify your programming tools can connect correctly.

This includes the Eagle files and basic schematic for the simplest circuit necessary to run the PIC32 MPU.
