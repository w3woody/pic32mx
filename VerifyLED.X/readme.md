# VerifyLED

This simple project tests the connection of a PIC32MX CPU (the [PIC32MX270F256B](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC32mx270f256b) CPU) to the [MPLab PICKit 4 In-Circuit Debugger](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/PG164140).

This consists of a very simple program which pulses a single LED on and off about once a second. This assumes the following basic circuit:
